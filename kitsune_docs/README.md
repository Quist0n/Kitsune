# Kitsune Documentation

This is the documentation for Kitsune, a paysite scraper utility

This will mainly cover the purposes of functions found in source code files and
explain what they should return and their purpose, and optionally some notes about internal
operations

This documentation is mainly intended for developers

## Rationale

The project is likely to expand in both scope and complexity as time goes on and as
of writing (May, 2021) there is about 700 sloc (source lines of code), from importers to utils.
